# Fucha-Bins: Regenerating City Spaces from Plastic Waste

## What We Do

We aim to address the issue of plastic waste by organizing our first community project to assemble and design sustainable trash **Smart Bins** for the recycling of plastic. **Fucha** bins, an abbreviation for **Fedha Uchafu**, meaning **lucrative waste management** aims to transform plastic waste collected from different areas into eco-bricks for sustainable spaces. We will start with a pilot project in the University of Dar-es-salaam area, and expand to other areas as we progress.

## Our Belief

We believe this initiative will help reduce plastic waste in our environment and get us on our way to contributing towards our **Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) 8, 11 & 13**. This will also act as a source of employment to artists and as tourism attraction. This is because of the artistic dust bins placed all over the city. 

The end goal is for the plastic collectedÂ to be recycled into regenerative products, say build classrooms/ shelters, chairs or anything that can be recycled and made out of plastic for a greater cause. Fucha Bins provides the mechanisms for it to happen.

## Business Process
